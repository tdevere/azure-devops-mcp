# üÜï Automated ICM Report Generation

## Overview

The Azure DevOps MCP Server now includes **revolutionary automated ICM (Incident Management) report generation** that transforms any build failure into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade incident report with a single prompt.

## üéØ What is ICM Report Generation?

Our ICM Report Generator automatically analyzes Azure DevOps build failures and creates professional incident management reports that include:

- **Automated severity assessment** and intelligent team assignment
- **Complete incident documentation** with business impact analysis
- **Immediate and long-term action plans** with realistic time estimates
- **Related incident correlation** and pattern detection
- **Risk mitigation strategies** and prevention measures
- **Automation recommendations** for faster resolution

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚ö° Instant Report Generation
Generate comprehensive ICM reports in **30 seconds** instead of hours of manual analysis.

### üéØ Smart Severity Assessment
Automatically determines incident severity (Sev1-Sev4) based on:
- Failure frequency and patterns
- Business impact assessment
- Deployment blocking status
- Customer impact level

### üß† Intelligent Team Assignment
Routes incidents to the right teams based on:
- Failure type (test, build, deployment, configuration)
- Pipeline characteristics
- Historical resolution patterns

### üìã Complete Documentation
Every ICM report includes:
- Executive summary with business impact
- Technical root cause analysis
- Detailed failure timeline
- Related incident correlation
- Comprehensive action plans

## üí¨ How to Use

### Simple Commands

Just ask the chat agent using natural language:

```
"Please create an ICM report for Project_001 last build failure"
```

```
"Generate an ICM report for build 1380 in project MyProject"
```

```
"Create ICM report for latest failure in pipeline DatabaseMigration"
```

### Advanced Options

For specific builds or timeframes:

```
"Generate an ICM report for the most recent build failure in ProjectAlpha from the last 24 hours"
```

```
"Create ICM reports for all failed builds in ProjectBeta from the last week"
```
